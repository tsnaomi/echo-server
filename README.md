echo_server
===========

Simple echo server and client.
-----------

A simple server that receives a simple message from a simple client, then sends the message back to the client. The client then prints out the message. 

Thank you to Stephen B. (lordsheepy) for advising me to create a separate accumulator function in the simple server and to then call that function from the simple client. So simple!
